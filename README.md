# Climbing Wrapped!

This is a simple web app that takes your tick data from mountain project and generates a simple year in review of your climbing stats. I built it using Flask and pure HTML and deployed it with Google App Engine.

Check it out at www.climbingwrapped.com

If you have suggestions for other categories to add or improvements to the aesthetic of the website feel free to fork or send over a pull request :)

Thanks Bharat & Vinh for the pointers along the way!
